# Configuration

Rocjitsu behavior is configured declaratively in JSON. Simulator configs
specify the component hierarchy, link connectivity, and simulation parameters;
DBT guest configs select the guest and host targets and execution backend.

## Simulator configs

Pre-built simulator configs are in `configs/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `gfx90a_mi210_kmd.json` | Single CDNA2 GPU (daemon/KFD mode) |
| `gfx942_cdna3.json` | Single CDNA3 GPU (standalone simulation) |
| `gfx942_cdna3_kmd.json` | Single CDNA3 GPU (daemon/KFD mode) |
| `gfx950_mi355x.json` | Single CDNA4 GPU (standalone simulation) |
| `gfx950_mi355x_kmd.json` | Single CDNA4 GPU (daemon/KFD mode) |
| `gfx950_mi355x_kmd_2gpu.json` | Two CDNA4 GPUs (multi-GPU daemon mode) |
| `gfx1250_mi455x.json` | Single CDNA5 GPU (standalone or PCI/VFIO simulation) |
| `gfx1250_mi455x_kmd_4gpu.json` | Four MI455X GPUs (multi-GPU daemon mode) |
| `gfx1251_synthetic.json` | Minimal synthetic gfx1251 topology for functional simulation; not a product model |
| `gfx1100_w7900.json` | Single RDNA3 GPU (standalone simulation) |
| `gfx1151.json` | Single RDNA3.5 GPU (standalone simulation) |
| `gfx1201_r9700.json` | Single RDNA4 GPU (standalone simulation) |

### PCI/VFIO guest compatibility

The gfx1250 PCI profile intentionally advertises no UVD, VCN, or JPEG hardware.
Compute-only guests therefore require an AMDGPU kernel containing commit
`4e07da515d1c` (`drm/amdgpu: enumerate UMSCH HW IP`) or an equivalent backport.
That change makes multimedia discovery accept a device with no VCN instance.
Rocjitsu does not emulate a placeholder media block, and adding one would expand
the device contract beyond the compute functionality modeled here.

The generic `scripts/run-vfio-guest.py` launcher requires externally prepared
guest kernel and initramfs artifacts. See
[QEMU VFIO-user compute](qemu-vfio.md) for the supported guest contract, the
complete launch command, GEMM qualification criteria, and troubleshooting.

## DBT guest configs

The checked-in [DBT guest-mode](rocjitsu_dbt_guest.md) configs cover hardware
and simulated host execution:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `guest_gfx950_on_gfx942.json` | CDNA4 guest on a CDNA3 hardware host |
| `guest_gfx950_on_simulated_gfx942.json` | CDNA4 guest on a simulated CDNA3 host |
| `guest_gfx950_on_gfx1201.json` | CDNA4 guest on an RDNA4 hardware host |

## JSON structure

The remaining sections describe simulator topology configs.

```json
{
  "max_ticks": 100000,
  "cpu_dispatch_threads": 1,
  "exec_mode": "functional",
  "vm": { "arch": "cdna4" },
  "topology": {
    "root": {
      "name": "soc", "type": "soc",
      "children": [
        { "name": "vram", "type": "gpu_memory" },
        { "name": "xcd[0:8]", "type": "xcd", "children": [...] }
      ]
    },
    "links": [
      {
        "pattern": "xcd[i].se[j].cu[k].req -> xcd[i].l2.cpl_[j*9+k]",
        "for_ranges": [
          { "var_name": "i", "start": 0, "end": 8 },
          { "var_name": "j", "start": 0, "end": 4 },
          { "var_name": "k", "start": 0, "end": 9 }
        ],
        "latency": 1, "weight": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The example above is intentionally minimal.

### Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_ticks` | int | Maximum simulation ticks (0 = unlimited) |
| `num_threads` | int | Simdojo engine partitions (one per XCD when partitioned). Omit for the default. |
| `cpu_dispatch_threads` | int | Inclusive functional dispatch width per SoC. Omitted/0 selects a preferred allocation; 1 forces serial dispatch. Clamped to per-CP CU capacity. |
| `cpu_thread_budget` | int | Automatic selection ceiling. Omitted/0 uses CPU affinity, with engine/dispatch cost capped at 32 and additive preset helpers up to 48 total; a positive value overrides the budget. |
| `async_helper_threads` | int | Shared MMA helpers per VM. Omitted/-1 selects the table; 0 disables; explicit values are 0–128. |
| `thread_allocations` | array | Preferred `num_threads` / `cpu_dispatch_threads` / `async_helper_threads` triples, selected by total execution-thread cost. |
| `exec_mode` | string | Execution mode. Use `"clocked"` for clocked execution; `"functional"` is the default/fallback. |
| `vm.arch` | string | ISA architecture family: `cdna3`, `cdna4`, `cdna5`, etc. |
| `vm.target` | string | Optional concrete GPU target, such as `gfx1250` or `gfx1251`. |

`vm.target` selects target-specific instruction legality and behavior within an
ISA architecture family. When it is present, it must belong to `vm.arch`. If
both the target binding and `vm.gpu.device.gfx_target_version` provide nonzero
packed versions, they must match. CDNA5 currently defaults an omitted target to
`gfx1250` for compatibility; new configs for an architecture with multiple
concrete targets should specify the target explicitly. RDNA3 has no default
target: only an explicit `gfx1100` target selects gfx1100 behavior.

`exec_mode` is matched literally: only the exact string `"clocked"` selects
clocked mode. If the field is omitted, set to `"functional"`, or given any
other value, the simulator runs in functional mode.

### Simulation threading

`num_threads` controls Simdojo engine partitions and their worker threads.
The value is clamped to the number of XCDs visible to the VM. With
`num_threads: 1`, all XCDs stay in one engine partition. With
`num_threads: 4` on the 8-XCD CDNA4 configs, whole XCD subtrees are assigned
round-robin to four partitions; with `num_threads: 8`, each XCD gets its own
partition. A single XCD is never split across partitions.

**Default.** Functional mode chooses an allocation from the target config's
`thread_allocations` table. The pure `resolve_execution_threads()` function
selects the largest effective allocation fitting the budget, after applying
explicit knob overrides and topology limits. A budget between table entries
uses the lower entry; it does not create workers merely to exhaust the budget.
Later entries break ties. The automatic total budget is CPU affinity, with a
minimum of one. Engine/dispatch cost stays capped at 32; helper entries may
use additional affinity. Shipped presets stop at 48 total. A positive
`cpu_thread_budget` overrides the budget, including the engine/dispatch cap. A config without a table uses serial defaults for unspecified
knobs. Clocked mode uses only engines, capped by affinity/budget and XCD count.

Explicit engine, dispatch and helper values take precedence and may exceed the automatic
ceiling. Engines are clamped to aggregate XCD count, and dispatch width to each
SoC's largest per-CP CU count. No workload inspection is involved.

Two separate contracts constrain consumers, and only the first is about the
config file.

**Stepping requires a single partition.** `rj_vm_step()` and
`SimulationEngine::step()` both reject a multi-partition engine. Either pin
`"num_threads": 1` in the config, or set `loaded.engine_config.num_threads = 1`
on the `LoadedConfig` after `load_config()` returns and before constructing the
engine — the loader resolves the default, it does not enforce it.

**A multi-partition engine needs a partition policy.** Code that builds an
engine by hand must call `partition_topology_by_xcds()` after `set_root()` and
before `create()`, or `create()` throws "multi-threaded SimulationEngine
requires an explicit topology partition policy". `rj_vm_create()` already does
this, so this only affects direct `SimulationEngine` users.

For multi-GPU VMs, both the default and the clamp use the aggregate XCD count
across all SoCs. Partition assignment follows one global XCD ordering across
the SoCs and is deliberately locality-agnostic. For example, two 8-XCD GPUs
permit up to 16 partitions, while `num_threads: 4` assigns XCDs from both GPUs
to each partition.

`gfx950_mi355x_kmd_2gpu.json` and `gfx1250_mi455x_kmd_4gpu.json` are the
shipped configs that still pin `num_threads: 1`. Any multi-partition setting on
the 2-GPU config hangs RCCL collectives (`AllReduce`, `Broadcast`, `AllGather`,
`ReduceScatter`) with the engine workers spinning and the simulation making no
progress; point-to-point `SendRecv` is unaffected. The hang predates the default
and reproduces with as few as two partitions. The 4-GPU config keeps the pin for
the same reason, though the hang has only been characterised on the 2-GPU
config. Remove the pins once it is fixed.

Raising `num_threads` only pays off if the work reaches more than one XCD, which
is decided by `AqlQueueConfig::xcd_fanout` rather than by how the queue was created (see
*Queue ownership and XCD fan-out* in `vm-design.md`). KFD sets the flag for
supported AQL compute queues, and a test can opt in when it registers a queue
directly; a queue without the flag keeps its whole grid on its owning XCD and
leaves the other partitions idle no matter how `num_threads` is set.

Setting the flag is not a guarantee that every partition gets work. The grid is
split in dispatch chunks, and a chunk is a whole cluster for a clustered
dispatch and a single workgroup otherwise, so what has to reach the XCD count is
the chunk count rather than the workgroup count: 16 workgroups in two
eight-workgroup clusters are two chunks, and on an eight-XCD SoC six XCDs take
an empty share and run nothing. Fan-out also reaches only the XCDs of the SoC
that owns the queue -- so in the two-GPU example above, one dispatch occupies at
most the partitions covering its own GPU.

#### Thread accounting and preferred allocations

For E engine threads, per-SoC inclusive dispatch widths D and H shared MMA
helpers, the retained execution allocation is **E + sum(D - 1) + H**. Each XCD submission runs on its
engine caller and can share the SoC's D-1 persistent workers. Callers progress
concurrently and join only their own submission. Runtime, doorbell and daemon
threads are outside this execution budget.

The single-GPU tables retain these synchronous engine/dispatch pairs (H=0):

| Budget | gfx950 E/D | gfx1250 E/D | gfx1100/gfx1151/gfx1201 E/D |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 |
| 2 | 1/2 | 1/2 | 1/2 |
| 4 | 2/3 | 1/4 | 1/4 |
| 8 | 2/7 | 2/7 | 1/8 |
| 16 | 8/9 | 8/9 | 1/16 |
| 24 | 8/17 | 8/17 | 1/16 |
| 32 | 8/25 | 8/25 | 1/32 |

The gfx950/gfx1250 tables also contain the [async MMA triples](async-instructions.md#thread-policy).
Both keep 8/25/0 at 32 threads. Affinity above 32 selects additive helper rows
at totals 34, 36, 40 and 48 (2, 4, 8 and 16 helpers). Larger hosts still select
48. `async_helper_threads: 0` retains the synchronous choices above.
A budget of 12 selects the eight-thread row.

Print allocations for any target without constructing a simulated GPU:

```sh
rocjitsu --config configs/gfx950_mi355x.json --thread-budget-table
```

The configured row reflects the file's budget and current affinity. Remaining
rows show explicit budget ceilings while retaining the file's knob overrides.
`rocjitsu --cpu-thread-budget N` (or `--cpu-thread-budget=N`) replaces JSON
`cpu_thread_budget` for that invocation, including the Configured row of
`--thread-budget-table`. The named file is never rewritten: the launcher copies
it to `effective_config.json` in the invocation's runtime directory, applies the
budget there, and launches from the copy, which is removed with the rest of that
directory. The flag is refused with `--attach`, which joins a daemon that has
already built its machine, and with a config whose `dbt_guest.simulator_config`
names a separate host config — the budget belongs in that file instead. The total
column reports actual allocation, which may be below the ceiling or above it when
explicitly overridden.

For multiple GPUs, selection counts every retained dispatch pool, so the same
pair costs more than on a single GPU. Useful parallelism depends on work reaching
those GPUs/XCDs and enough runnable CUs being available. Multi-GPU presets pin
both `num_threads: 1` and `cpu_dispatch_threads: 1` for RCCL: multiple engine
partitions hang, and extra dispatch workers slow the measured small collectives.
Increasing the budget alone retains these serial defaults.

Set `cpu_dispatch_threads: 0` to opt into the parallel granules below, or set a
positive dispatch width explicitly. The engine stays at one unless overridden.

| Budget | MI355X, 2 GPUs E/D | Retained threads | MI455X, 4 GPUs E/D | Retained threads |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1/1 | 1 | 1/1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1/1 | 1 | 1/1 | 1 |
| 4 | 1/2 | 3 | 1/1 | 1 |
| 8 | 1/4 | 7 | 1/2 | 5 |
| 16 | 1/8 | 15 | 1/4 | 13 |
| 24 | 1/12 | 23 | 1/6 | 21 |
| 32 | 1/16 | 31 | 1/8 | 29 |

D is inclusive dispatch width per GPU. The one engine submits synchronously,
so these retained pools do not imply simultaneous execution on every GPU.
Dispatch workers can accelerate compute batches. The E=1 pin addresses the
documented RCCL hang; the D=1 default preserves small-collective performance.

Mirage embeds the tables in its RocJITsu backend at build time and
selects them by the agent's GPU target and GPU count. The hardware agent format carries no
host scheduling policy. Unknown targets use the serial fallback. For multiple
GPUs, it uses the matching native preset when available. Other GPU counts
convert each single-GPU granule's budget B to E=1, D=1+floor((B-1)/GPUs) and H=0,
then leave selection to rocjitsu.
Its multi-GPU configurations default to E=1/D=1/H=0 for the same reasons. A positive
engine override can change that pin;
`num_threads: 0` retains it. Profile options may override `cpu_thread_budget`,
`num_threads`, `cpu_dispatch_threads` and `async_helper_threads`. A supplied
config file is used verbatim. Automatic helper selection (-1) preserves the
multi-GPU H=0 default; a positive override can enable helpers.
Checkpoints retain the configured requests and tables, including custom tables,
so restore re-evaluates that policy for the receiving process's affinity. They
preserve the user's configuration, rather than an exact host allocation or a
reference to a runtime preset that may change. Updating a runtime therefore does
not replace a checkpoint's custom policy with new builtin tuning.

**Migration.** New functional JSON configurations without a table use serial
values for automatic knobs. Previously, automatic engine sizing followed the
XCD count and explicit `cpu_dispatch_threads: 0` selected a host-wide dispatch
budget. Add a `thread_allocations` table or positive knob overrides to enable
parallel execution. Shipped presets already encode their preferred tables.
Legacy checkpoints with explicit zero dispatch and no allocation metadata retain
the old dispatch-only host sizing, including when saved again. An absent legacy
dispatch field remains serial; a present empty allocation table uses the new
serial fallback.


### Topology

Components are defined hierarchically under `topology.root`. Range
expansion (`xcd[0:8]`) creates multiple instances. Links connect
component ports using pattern expressions with loop variables.

### Memory wait diagnostics

With memory wait diagnostics enabled, compute units warn when an instruction reads
or overwrites a pending memory result without a sufficient wait. Results still
execute eagerly. See
[memory wait diagnostics](memory-wait-diagnostics.md) for coverage and the
`memory_wait_diagnostics` setting (`off`, the default, or `warn`).
On gfx1250, this setting also controls XCNT replay-source warnings. Both checks
are disabled by default and enabled together with `memory_wait_diagnostics=warn`.

### KFD device sections

KFD device identity can be defined by `vm.gpu.device` for a simulated GPU and
by `dbt_guest.guest_device` for a DBT guest. These sections define properties
reported through the simulated sysfs topology (GPU ID, vendor/device IDs, CU
counts, memory sizes, etc.). A simulated device's properties must match the
component hierarchy defined in `topology`.

In either device section, a device with one or more regular SDMA engines must
explicitly set a nonzero `num_sdma_queues_per_engine` value.

## FlatBuffers schema

The JSON config is validated against FlatBuffers schemas in `schemas/`:

- `simulation_config.fbs` — topology and simulation parameters
- `checkpoint.fbs` — simulation state checkpointing

## Multi-GPU

Multi-GPU configs define multiple SoCs with distinct GPU IDs and
location IDs. Each GPU gets its own command processor, memory, and
cache hierarchy. The daemon manages all GPUs and routes KFD ioctls
to the correct device based on `gpu_id`.

`configs/gfx950_mi355x_kmd_2gpu.json` is the default multi-GPU
configuration for RCCL tests. `configs/gfx1250_mi455x_kmd_4gpu.json`
provides a four-GPU daemon topology for explicit multi-GPU runs.
