# rocjitsu: ROCm&trade; Just-in-Time Suite

[![rocjitsu CI](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/actions/workflows/rocjitsu-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/actions/workflows/rocjitsu-ci.yml)

An emulation toolkit for running AMD GPU applications on simulated or
real hardware. Supports three execution strategies:

- **Simulation** — Full ISA emulation on simulated GPU hardware via
  LD_PRELOAD interposition. No physical GPU or kernel module required.
- **Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT)** — Cross-ISA translation enabling
  applications compiled for one GPU architecture to run on another.
- **Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI)** — Runtime instrumentation
  of GPU kernels for profiling, tracing, and analysis.

## Building

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for CMake options, sanitizers,
and formatting setup.

## Running tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build
```

HIP kernel tests and RCCL daemon tests require an ROCm installation.
They are disabled automatically when `hipcc` or `libhsa-runtime64` is
not found.

## Running HIP workloads

```bash
# Local mode (in-process simulation)
rocjitsu --config configs/gfx950_mi355x_kmd.json -- ./my_hip_app

# Daemon mode (separate daemon process)
rocjitsu --daemon --config configs/gfx950_mi355x_kmd.json -- ./my_hip_app
```

See [docs/rocjitsu-cli.md](docs/rocjitsu-cli.md) for all CLI modes.

## VGPR observation contract

Execution plugins observe architectural instruction-level VGPR reads and
writes. Callback lane and byte masks describe the architectural register
effect, including masked and sub-dword operations. Internal storage operations
used to preserve unaffected register state are not reported as additional
instruction effects.

Asynchronous memory operations use a separate lifecycle. The race detector
records register dependencies when the operation is issued. Later completion
updates register storage without reporting the same instruction effect again.
See
[docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) for the plugin contract.

## Running PyTorch

```bash
rocjitsu --daemon --config configs/gfx950_mi355x_kmd.json -- \
  python3 -c "import torch; x = torch.randn(4, 4, device='cuda'); print(x @ x)"
```

See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for container setup with PyTorch.
